Welcome to my dungeon, thanks for meeting me at such short notice. 
I have been having some problems with my employees such as goblins killing each other and running away from combat.
This dungeon is pretty popular for a lot of adventuring heroes.
What is it with random people wanting to explore caves?
Anyway, I heard that you might be able to fix things around here, hopefully it won't take too long, heroes normally arrive very soon.
All of this is affecting my bottom-line, not sure I can meet my gold quota if this keeps up for too much longer.
I would like to discuss parts of your submitted resume, you told me you had a degree in spellcraft, where did you study?

Not even close, nice try though. It was 24,601. 
I was really looking for a wizard with time magic skills. 
I'm sorry but you won't get the job here.

That... how did you? Was that luck? 
Interesting, I will be the goblins into meet you.
I hope you get all of this fixed quick, heroes are going to arrive soon.
