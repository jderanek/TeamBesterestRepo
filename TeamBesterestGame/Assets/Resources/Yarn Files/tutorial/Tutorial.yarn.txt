Welcome to my dungeon, thanks for meeting me at such short notice. 
I have been having some problems with my employees, and I've been told you can help.
Some of the goblins are killing each other, others running away from combat, you get the idea.
This dungeon is pretty popular for a lot of adventuring heroes.
Random people wanting to explore caves provide excellent profits... if we can take care of them first.
Anyway, I heard that you might be able to fix things around here, hopefully it won't take too long, heroes normally arrive very soon.
All of this is affecting my bottom-line, not sure I can meet my gold quota if this keeps up for too much longer.
I would like to discuss parts of your submitted resume, you told me you had a degree in spellcraft, where did you study?

[[Uh no... school is for losers.|Tutorial11]]
[[Yes, I was magus cum laude at Albion U.|Tutorial12]]

[[At Albion U, I did my graduate work in time magic.|Tutorial122]]

Really now? So what number am I thinking of?

[[Uh.. 42?|Tutorial1221]]
[[It is 1 for sure.|Tutorial1221]]
[[Let me guess, 501?|Tutorial1221]]
[[1453, definitely.|Tutorial1221]]

[[24,601.|Tutorial1222]]

Oh really? What was your speciality?

[[I did not really focus on one area, more like a general knowledge of wizardy.|Tutorial121]]

<<if $timeMagicSpecific is true>>
[[I did my dissertation on the morals and ethics of time magic.|Tutorial122]]

I don't think this job would be the best fit for you. Good luck in your other endeavors.

Not even close, nice try though. It was 24,601. 
I was really looking for a wizard with time magic skills. 
I'm sorry but you won't get the job here.

That... how did you? Was that luck? 
Interesting, I will bring the goblins in to meet you.
I hope you get all of this fixed quick, heroes are going to arrive soon.
You have one meeting to make this work, or I'm going to get my money back out of your hide.
