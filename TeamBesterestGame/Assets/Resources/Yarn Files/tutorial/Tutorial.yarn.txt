Not even close, nice try though. It was 24,601. 
I was really looking for a wizard with time magic skills. 
I'm sorry but you won't get the job here.

That... how did you? Was that luck? 
Interesting, I will bring the goblins in to meet you.
I hope you get all of this fixed quick, heroes are going to arrive soon.
You have one meeting to make this work, or I'm going to get my money back out of your hide.
