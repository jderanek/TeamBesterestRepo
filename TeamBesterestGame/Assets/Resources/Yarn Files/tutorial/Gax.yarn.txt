Gax: Hello, I'm Gax!
Gax: Toughest goblin you'll find in these parts!
[[I noticed you two arguing before. What were you arguing with him about?|Gax11]]
[[That's a pretty hefty axe you've got there!|Gax12]]
[[Chopping down heroes 9-5, then chopping down trees after work I assume?|Gax13]]
#The following is unlocked by completing the tutorial scenario once.
[[I'm familiar with your love of axes, Gax. I think there's a third option you haven't thought about yet.|Gax14]]

Gax: Oh, just Skord being a numbskull is all.
Gax: He thinks his toothpicks he calls swords are better than an axe!
Gax: Ridiculous!
[[Axes *are* pretty cool, in my opinion.|Gax111]]
[[Why do you like axes the best?|Gax112]]
[[Ridiculous? Swords are a classic!|Gax113]]

Gax: You've got a brain on your shoulders, I can tell!
Gax: Why don't you try telling that to Skord over there. 
Gax: We can see if you can settle things once and for all!
[[Skord doesn't see your way then, I assume?|Gax1111]]
[[Sounds like a sound plan, all things considered.|Gax1112]]
[[Settling things *is* why we're here, after all. One way or another.|Gax1113]]

Gax: Not at all!
Gax: Like I said before, he thinks swords are better than axes.
Gax: Ridiculous!
Gax: He's right there you know, you should ask him yourself if you haven't already.

Gax: They're multipurpose tools!
Gax: They hit hard, and fell heroes in one swoop...
Gax: ...they can even be used back home to cut wood!
Gax: Can't beat versatility!
[[Sound logic, I suppose.|Gax1121]]

Gax: And who's side are *you* on, exactly?
Gax: You don't work for the heroes secretly, do you?
Gax: Haha, just kidding.
Gax: But seriously, axes really are just better.
Gax: Thems the facts.
[[Uh-huh. Right, let me get back to you on that one.|Gax1113]]

[[Axes *are* pretty cool, in my opinion.|Gax111]]

[[Axes *are* pretty cool, in my opinion.|Gax111]]

Gax: While whatever it might be may be cooler than a sword...
Gax: ...is it *really* something that can be cooler than an axe?
[[Halberds are basically axes with longer reach, if you think about it.|Gax141]]
[[Polearms can give you a mighty slash, and you can smack heroes with the blunt end when they get close!|Gax142]]

Gax: ...is that real?
[[Very real, and very within your reach. You just need to put the axe down for a day!|Gax1411]]
[[No, I made it up on the spot. Of course it's real!|Gax1412]]

[[Just focus on wielding a new weapon before the heroes show up.|Gax14112]]
