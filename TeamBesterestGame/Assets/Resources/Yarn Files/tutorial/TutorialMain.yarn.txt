#Very first tree. Should appear on startup of the tutorial,

Chrona: Ahh, you must be the new employee I’m mentoring today!
Chrona: Greetings, I’m Chrona, a veteran Time-Wizard. 
Chrona: I've worked for Deja Review for over 30 years!
Chrona: Though, sometimes it starts to feel like 35. 
Chrona: Time-travel, you know?
Chrona: Anyway, our goal here at Deja Review is to turn around failing dungeons through investigation and our keen wits.
Chrona: Dungeon Keepers expect us to turn around their dungeon for them, with a 24-hour guarantee of success or their money back!
Chrona: We’ve never once failed job, and I don’t plan on starting today!
Chrona: You’re going to do great, I can just sense it. 
Chrona: Let’s get to it, shall we?

#After Introduction
Chrona: Alright, first things first...
Chrona: I like to show up to the Dungeon a little early, and watch how the employees do things on their own.
Chrona: This should help us find out exactly what the problem is, and give us an idea of what to look for when we go in to talk to the employees ourselves.
Chrona: Click on the Enter Dungeon button when you’re ready to begin.

Heroes storm the dungeon.
#Some animation for heroes popping up.
Gax and Skord appear to be arguing about something.
#Some continuous animation of them both bouncing angrily. 
#The bouncing should not be synced with each other.
Gax and Skord are so distracted with their heated argument that the Heroes defeat them before they can retaliate.
#Bouncing intensifies
#Heroes kill them? some shaking animation then they fade out
The Heroes escape with all the gold!

Chroma: Ah, right right. It appears there’s a bit of a disagreement between the two.
Chroma: Resolving that argument will likely be the key to solving this Dungeon’s problems!
Chroma: Let’s go to it, then. Close the log by clicking the Close button.

Chroma: There they are! What… interesting individuals.
Chroma: They’ve likely been told about our appointment already, so they should be friendly enough.
Chroma: Let’s just make sure we don’t push their buttons too much, or else they might stop talking to us.
Chroma: Thanks to our Wizard powers, we can use magic to scry into their emotional states!
Chroma: This will appear as a bar beneath the goblins portraits.
Chroma: If that gets too low, they likely won’t listen to a word we have to say anymore.
Chroma: Based on my extensive experience… hmm...
Chroma: I'd say you can likely mess with your typical goblin around three times before they start to get real mad.
Chroma: Assuming they’re in a good mood, of course. 
Chroma: Anyway, pick one of the goblins and let’s get started!

#IF GAX IS INTERVIEWED FIRST:
Chroma: Interesting. It seems Gax likes the Axe, but his coworker doesn’t agree.
Chroma: Seems like a petty thing to start a fight about, but I’ve seen worse. 
Chroma: Let’s talk to Skord now to get a better idea of what’s going on.
Chroma: You should always try to talk to as many of the employees as you can during an interview session.
Chroma: We’ve only got this one appointment, so we need to try to find out as much as we can.
Chroma: Remember, if you need a refresher as to what happened when they fought the Heroes earlier, just click the Log button! It’s available whenever you need it.

Chroma: Well. Looks like what we have here is a simple disagreement turned into a full on battle of ideas!
Chroma: Skord loves swords… and Gax loves axes…
Chroma: I’d bet they’re waiting for us to pick a side.
Chroma: Maybe if we do, that’ll settle the argument once and for all!
Chroma: Interviewing either of them will likely force us to pick. So go ahead and decide what you think is best.

Chroma: Odd, it seems we didn’t actually solve the problem. That’s not good!
Chroma: For normal people, this would mean that the Dungeon Keeper gets their money back…
Chroma: ...but since we’re also Time Wizards, all we have to do is rewind time back to before we interviewed them in the first place!
Chroma: How else do you think it’s possible for our firm to have a 100% success rate? Social skills?
Chroma: Thankfully, travelling back in time doesn’t cost us anything.
Chroma: The only downside is that we have to start the interview all over again.
Chroma: Though, this time we already know about their argument, so we can use our prior knowledge to pursue alternate routes of conversation.
Chroma: Think about it like unlocking different paths to a destination!
Chroma: Click on the Rewind button when you’re ready to go back in time!

Chrona: I've worked for Deja Review for over 30 years!
Chrona: .....Just kidding, haha! We’ve already been through this.
Chrona: If you need a refresher as to what originally went wrong, go ahead and watch them try to fight again by clicking on Enter Dungeon.
Chrona: If you feel ready to hop right in, we can skip that step and head straight to the interview. The choice is yours!

Chroma: Alright, if I remember correctly, Skord liked swords, and Gax liked axes. 
Chroma: When we picked a side, they started to argue again anyway.
Chroma: Maybe if we pick the other side, they’ll settle down?
Chroma: Alternatively, maybe there’s a third option we can pick.
Chroma: Maybe they can find some sort of common ground!
Chroma: Interview both of them again, and make whatever decision you feel is right! 
Chroma: If you make a mistake, we can just rewind time and try again, so no worries, my friend!

Chroma: ...well, points for persistence, at least. But I don’t think that’s going to work.
Chroma: We need to try other options, or look for alternate paths that can make these two stop fighting.

Chroma: They actually did it! Congratulations, my apprentice, I knew we could figure it out!
Chroma: Best part of it all, we still get paid. They’re none-the-wiser to our time-traveling antics!
Chroma: ...well, I think, anyway.
Chroma: That’s enough for today, though! I think you’re ready to tackle future jobs on your own. 
Chroma: There are likely far larger dungeons out there to deal with, but the core method remains the same!
Chroma: Interview as many goblins as you can, and try to figure out how to fix their problems so they can kill those Heroes as best as possible!
Chroma: If you ever feel like you need my help again, just click the Tutorial button again to Time-Travel back to when we first met!
Chroma: ...weird sounding, I know. But you’ll get used to it, I’m certain!
Chroma: Best of luck to you, then! Make those dungeons shine!
