Skord: Greetings! I am Skord. The most cultured goblin in these parts.
Skord: Especially when compared to that oaf, Gax.
[[I take it you two don't exactly get along, then?|Skord11]]
[[Cultured is definitely one word you can use to describe that outfit.|Skord12]]
[[What's a cultured gobling doing in a business of killing heroes?|Skord13]]

[[I've heard you're a fan of the finesse of a sword. But have you ever tried using a spear?|Skord14]]

Skord: Of course not!
Skord: That swine thinks axes are superior to the sword!
Skord: Total nonsense, I say!
[[Can't go wrong with swords. They're a classic!|Skord111]]
[[Why do you like swords the best?|Skord112]]
[[Axes aren't that bad. They can dish out a good chop!|Skord113]]

Skord: Ah, a wizard of culture, I see. I was starting to wrry that was in short supply these days.
Skord: You think you can go over and tell gave about the superiority of swords?
Skord: That way we can all move on from this petty debate.
[[I can give it a shot, sure.|Skord1111]]
[[I can't imagine why Gax doesn't agree with you.|Skord1112]]
[[I'm here to settle things one way or the other, so...|Skord1113]]

Skord: Tey've got a multitude of uses!
Skord: Some are good for stabbing, some more for slashing...
Skord: There's a sword for every occassion known to Goblinkind!
Skord: A *real* goblin's weapon, if you ask me.
Skord: And you can't deny the aesthetic appeal inherent to a sword!

Skord: ...and yet, he still refuses to listen to me.
Skord: Why don't you deal with him now, speaking of which?

Skord: Careful! You're starting to sound like Gax.
Skord: Every second spent exposed to such a barbaric individual and his weapon surely kills braincells.
[[Uh-huh. Right, let me get back to you on that one.|Skord1131]]

Skord: You couldn't catch me in anything less than the finest silks!
Skord: That, and a mixture of fencing gear.
Skord: The finest sport for the greatest weapon there is, the sword!
[[Why do you like swords the best?|Skord112]]
[[You like fencing, huh?|Skord122]]

Skord: Absolutely! The finest sport for the finest individuals.
Skord: Especially since it uses the sword!
Skord: Clearly a sign of greatness, all of it.
Skord: I can't fathom why someone would use an axe for fighting.
[[Let me think before I commit to anything, here.|Skord1123]]

Skord: Killing heroes is the most honorable profession available!
Skord: The glory! The swordsmanship!
Skord: ...the income!
Skord: Especially the sweet, sweet swordsmanship.
Skord: ........and the income.
[[What's up with the emphasis on swordsmanship?|Skord112]]

Skord: Truth be told, it hasn't been great of late.
Skord: I blame it on Gax.
Skord: He won't shut up about axes and their inferiority even when the heroes appear!
Skord: That ingrate!
Skord: Once I convince him swords are the superior weapon, things will turn around. You'll see!
[[I can't imagine why Gax doesn't agree with you.|Skord1112]]
[[Definitely not both of your faults. I'll get back to you on that in a second.|Skord1322]]

Skord: ...hmm... a spear you say?
Skord: Why would I consider using a spear?
Skord: It's no axe, I'll give you that, but...
[[It's easy to use, you fight from a safe distance, there's a number of benefits.|Skord141]]
[[A spear takes much less effort to wield than a sword, and is equally stylish.|Skord142]]
