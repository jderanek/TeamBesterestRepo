HIYAH!!

(The strawman's head comes clean off, the bucket completely destroyed)

I-I may have overdid it...

<<ChangeSpeaker SoundManager Gordon>>
That was incredible! Nice work! You're a natural!

<<ChangeSpeaker SoundManager Glenn>>
Y-you really think so? That means a lot coming from you!
So what move is next?
