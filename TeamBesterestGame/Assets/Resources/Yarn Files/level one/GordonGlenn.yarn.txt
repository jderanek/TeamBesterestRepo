H-huh?
Oh, yeah. I-I'm Glenn...
I'm the... front-line fighter around here.
[[Front-line fighter? That is quite brave.|Coward11]]
[[You must see a lot of combat then.|Coward12]]
[[Tell me about yourself.|Coward13]]
[[I think I know a way to get Gordon to let you fight alongside him. Try ambushing the heroes!|Coward1332]]

I do appreciate all the help you are doing for us.

That kid won't leave me alone!
Well, until the heroes show up and he books it out of there.
I finally get some peace and quiet.
But then we both die and I'm back to getting an earful...

Time manipulation? Could you use some of it and make me not apply to work here?
*Sigh* If I didn't need the money, I would've quit weeks ago.
Glenn really needs to learn about privacy and personal space.

[[I will pull him aside and talk to him about it|Gordon1111]]

Get Glenn to leave me alone for starters.
I think the dungeon master gets his kicks watching me get annoyed.

Yeah, that is the same thing everyday.
Glenn runs away, heroes come in and kill us both, rinse and repeat.

I think he is impressed by my combat skills, he keeps telling me to "show me your moves!"
I told him once that I didn't believe he could pull them off.
That was a big mistake on my part as he kept trying the moves over and over, making sure I acted as guide.
To be honest, being dead is the best part of the job, as Glenn can't annoy me then.

[[What do you think is the best option going forward?|Gordon121]]

I already told you, a silence spell.
But in all seriousness, I think the kid just needs some confidence.
I guess he sees how gung-ho I am in battle and wants to emulate me.
[[Maybe Glenn views you as an inspiring figure, but can't muster the courage to join you. Maybe I could ask him instead?|Gordon1211]]

Are you kidding? That would only make it worse.
I guess he is trying to impress me or whatever.
He is doing a poor job as I am not really inspired by him running away every battle.

[[Why does he run away? Do you know?|Gordon1221]]
[[Impress you? Why would he want to do that?|Gordon1222]]

And to use his indoor voice...
