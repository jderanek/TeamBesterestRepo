I think he is impressed by my combat skills, he keeps telling me to "show me your moves!"
I told him once that I didn't believe he could pull them off.
That was a big mistake on my part as he kept trying the moves over and over, making sure I acted as guide.
To be honest, being dead is the best part of the job, as Glenn can't annoy me then.
