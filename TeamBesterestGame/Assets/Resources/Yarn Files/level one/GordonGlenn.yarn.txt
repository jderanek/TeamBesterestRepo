H-huh?
Oh, yeah. I-I'm Glenn...
I'm the... front-line fighter around here.
[[Front-line fighter? That is quite brave.|Coward11]]

You are right, but is also lets me get away safely when heroes arrive.

Hey, you are the wizard guy the boss talked about? Hopefully you know your stuff.

That kid won't leave me alone!
Well, until the heroes show up and he books it out of there.
I finally get some peace and quiet.
But then we both die and I'm back to getting an earful...

[[Why is he so talkative?|Gordon131]]

Time manipulation? Could you use some of it and make me not apply to work here?
*Sigh* If I didn't need the money, I would've quit weeks ago.
Glenn really needs to learn about privacy and personal space.

[[I will pull him aside and talk to him about it|Gordon1111]]

Get Glenn to leave me alone for starters.
I think the dungeon master gets his kicks watching me get annoyed.

Yeah, that is the same thing everyday.
Glenn won't shut up, heroes come in and kill us, rinse and repeat.
Or I guess revive and repeat in our case.

[[What can I do to change that?|Gordon121]]

Does your magic give you enhanced perception or something?

I think it is because he isn't the most confident person.
Maybe you could talk to him about it?

[[Yeah, I could do that|Gordon1211]]
===
title: Gordon131
tags: 
colorID: 0
position: 251,2885
---
I think he is impressed by my combat skills, he keeps telling me to "show me your moves!"
I told him once that I didn't believe he could pull them off.
That was a big mistake on my part as he kept trying the moves over and over, making sure I acted as guide.
To be honest, being dead is the best part of the job, as Glenn can't annoy me then.

[[What do you think is the best option going forward?|Gordon121]]
[[Have you tried talking to him since then?|Gordon122]]
===

I already told you, a silence spell.
But in all seriousness, I think the kid just needs some confidence.
I guess he sees how gung-ho I am in battle and wants to emulate me.
[[Thanks for the tip, I will talk to Glenn about that|Gordon1211]]

Are you kidding? That would only make it worse.
I guess he is trying to impress me or whatever.
He is doing a poor job as I am not really inspired by him running away every battle.

[[Why does he run away? Do you know?|Gordon1221]]
[[Impress you? Why would he want to do that?|Gordon1222]]
===

I just hope he understands.
I don't hate the guy, he just needs to learn about personal space.
And to use his indoor voice...

I mean I personally think he is a coward.

He always goes on and on about wanting to be strong or such.
