Hello! I'm Gabbin! Nice to meet you!
I hope you've had an excellent time with us all so far!

Nilbog likes to act like a lone wolf!
He won't talk to me, or work as a team when heroes show up!
I keep trying to reach out to him, but he just ignores me.
He'll listen eventually! I think!
[[That sounds rather invasive.|Gabbin11111]]
[[I'm sure if you keep at it, he'll come around!|Gabbin11112]]
[[You need to cut that out. It's probably annoying.|Gabbin11113]]

...Look. I need Gabbin off my back. Can you at least do that?

[[Oh no, I need you both to work together.|Nilbog11111]]
[[So if he backs off, things will work smoother?|Nilbog11112]]

....Fine. I'll spell it out for you.
Gabbin is a pain. I need him to leave me alone.
Until that happens, things aren't going to work.

[[That sounds like a personal problem.|Nilbog1231]]
[[How would you recommend dealing with the problem?|Nilbog1232]]
[[Sounds simple enough.|Nilbog1233]]

...Easy. Get him to respect my personal space.
...Or just get him to leave me alone, period. Either works for me.

[[That first choice sounds good to me.|Nilbog12321]]
[[Getting him to leave you alone should be simple enough.|Nilbog12322]]

...How do you figure that?
