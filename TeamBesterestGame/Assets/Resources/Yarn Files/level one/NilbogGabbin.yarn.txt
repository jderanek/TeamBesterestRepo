Nilbog likes to act like a lone wolf!
He won't talk to me, or work as a team when heroes show up!
I keep trying to reach out to him, but he just ignores me.
He'll listen eventually! I think!

I better call my buddy from Gondon, his name is Gerlock Golmes, the worlds greatest detective!
He'll get to the bottom of this.

Just proud that Nilbog is putting force such a great effort in order to make us better at our jobs!

Right away Mr. Time Wizard! Of course we should make sure our uniforms are in order, or else the heroes wont respect our dungeon enough!

<<ChangeSpeaker SoundManager Nilbog>>
...
...I'll do one more run through of our... *my* trenchcoat. Can't have any holes in this when the heroes hit me.

<<ChangeSpeaker SoundManager Voiceless>>
[The two goblins begin to look all around their clothes for any signs of wear and tear.]
[They both appear to be finding small knicks and holes in their clothes.]
[Nilbog and crew seem to be satisfied with their trenchcoat.]
[Hopefully now if the happen to fall, atleast Gabbin wont seem all of them.]

<<ChangeSpeaker SoundManager Nilbog>>
Gabbin, there is something I... *we* need to tell you. The Nilbog you know, is actually us three kids in a big trenchcoat...

<<ChangeSpeaker SoundManager Gabbin>>
But... but... children shouldn't be here! Dungeons aren't the place for young ones!

<<ChangeSpeaker SoundManager Nilbog>>
You are right, but we aren't just any children. You wanted to become friends and close to the goblin "Nilbog".
So why not become friends with the three goblins that make up "Nilbog"?

<<ChangeSpeaker SoundManager Gabbin>>
Well... I still don't like the idea of kids fighting heroes in a dungeon...
But if you guys are going to be here anyways, I should atleast try my best to help you out.

<<ChangeSpeaker SoundManager Voiceless>>
[The group of 4 goblins appear to continue talking, all 3 children formally introducing themselves to Gabbin.]
[Gabbin seems to not be too fazed by his new coworkers. Seems like everything will work out for the better.]

<<ChangeSpeaker SoundManager Nilbog>>
Actually... on second though... this might not be the time to tell you Gabbin.

<<ChangeSpeaker SoundManager Gabbin>>
Why not? No one's told me anything yet... I don't like being left out of these secrets!

<<ChangeSpeaker SoundManager Nilbog>>
We... *I* knew this wasn't the right choice...

<<ChangeSpeaker SoundManager Gabbin>>
Why of course I do sir! It seemed super awesome! Can't to see it in action!

<<ChangeSpeaker SoundManager Nilbog>>
Well.. uh... just you wait Gabbin... it is going to blow you away. Both of us have never seen anything like it...
If you dont mind, we... sorry, *I* must get back to practicing it, or else it may not be perfect.

<<ChangeSpeaker SoundManager Gabbin>>
Dont worry Nilbog! I'm sure it is going to wow me anyways! Perfect or not!

<<ChangeSpeaker SoundManager Voiceless>>
[Nilbog begins shaking in his trenchcoat, the boys seem to be getting ready for their next *trick*.]
[Gabbin seems to not be too fazed by the weird movements.]

<<ChangeSpeaker SoundManager Gabbin>>
Actually I dont sir... I dont believe you ever told me about this technique.

<<ChangeSpeaker SoundManager Nilbog>>
...stop. We never... *I* never said anything about that Gabbin. Just ignore him. 
We should be getting ready for our next shift anyways.
