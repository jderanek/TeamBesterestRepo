Nilbog likes to act like a lone wolf!

Sorcerers are all the cool parts of wizards, without any of the effort involved!

[[They give us all a bad name! Irresponsible is what that is! No study at all!|Gabbin22111311111]]

Oh.
Spy Wizards sound so cool! Why don't we have one of those instead of a Time Wizard? No offense!

[[Time Wizards are absolutely cooler than Spies.|Gabbin2221]]

I feel you. I've always wanted to be a goblin diplomat, but this was the next closest thing I could think of!
It's never too late to follow your dreams though! 

[[Wait, what? How is killing heroes anything close to diplomacy?|Gabbin22231]]

Instead of bringing peace through friendship, I bring peace by removing dangerous heroes from the world!

I've found it's important to rationalize what you do, so you're not filled with self-doubt at the end of the day!
Kind of like how it sounds like you are with being a Time Wizard instead of a Spy Wizard!

Those laws keep growing goblins safe, and not exposed to the violence of office life!
Keep those thoughts to yourself, or I'll report you to inHumane Resources! Sheesh.

It's a little hard to see, but I sure do feel cooler! Don't you agree, Nilbog?
