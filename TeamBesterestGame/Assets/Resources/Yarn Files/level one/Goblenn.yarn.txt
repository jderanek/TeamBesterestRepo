H-huh?
Oh, yeah. I-I'm Glenn...
I'm the... front-line fighter around here.
[[Front-line fighter? That is quite brave.|Coward11]]

I always hear snide remarks about me being a deserter between shifts, almost daily in fact...

You are right, but is also lets me get away safely when heroes arrive.

I think that stealth is important aspect of combat.
Discretion is the better part of valor as they say.
