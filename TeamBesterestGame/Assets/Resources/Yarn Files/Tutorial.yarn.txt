Hello! Welcome to my dungeon, thanks for meeting me at such short notice. 
I have been having some issues with my employees, goblins killing each other, running away and so on.
I heard that you might be able to fix things around here, so I would like to discuss parts of your submitted resume. 
So you told me you had a degree in spellcraft, where did you study?
[[Uh no? School is for losers.|Tutorial11]]
[[Yes, I was magus cum laude at Albion U.|Tutorial12]]

[[Let me guess, 501?|Tutorial1221]]
[[1453, definitely|Tutorial1221]]
<<elseif $guessProof is true>>
[[24,601.|Tutorial1222]]
<<endif>>

Oh really? What was your speciality?
<<if $timeMagicSpecific is false>>
[[I did not really focus on one area, more like a general knowledge of wizardy.|Tutorial121]]
<<elseif $timeMagicSpecific is true>>
[[I did my dissertation on the morals and ethics of time magic.|Tutorial122]]

I don't think this job would be the best fit for you. Good luck in your other endeavors.

Not even close, nice try though. It was 24,601. 
I was really looking for a wizard with time magic skills. 
I'm sorry but you won't get the job here.
