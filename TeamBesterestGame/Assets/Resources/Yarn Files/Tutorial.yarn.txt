Hello! Welcome to my dungeon. I have been having some issues with my employees, goblins killing each other, running away and so on.
I heard that you might be able to fix things around here, so I would like to discuss parts of your submitted resume. So you told me
you had a degree in spellcraft?
[[Uh no? School is for losers.|Tutorial11]]
[[Yes, I was magus cum laude at Placeholder U.|Tutorial12]]
