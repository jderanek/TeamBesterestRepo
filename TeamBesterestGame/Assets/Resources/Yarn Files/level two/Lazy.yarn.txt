[[|Confused]]#But didnt I see your partner get killed by a couple of Heroes and they proceeded to walk on through?
[[|Stern]]#I think I know the difference between faking and a goblin knocked out cold, why are you so tired?
[[|Believe]]#O sorry, my bad. Didn't notice the tactics being used in the moment. Please continue using your skills as such.

[[|Realization]]#But, you can do that until you have made enough money from working here right? And you dont get enough money because you keep dying on the job
[[|Insult]]#Well, from what I've seen of your dungeon work, not so sure you have what it takes to make phones. Stick to the hero killing bud
