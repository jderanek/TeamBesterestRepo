[[|Brick]]#Making sure, but is your phone just a brick with a screen painted on?

[[|Understanding]]#Makes perfect sense to me. But it seems like the phone is a bigger problem then you think it is. Almost like you use the excuse of Lazy to play on your phone more?
[[|Threaten]]#Because I am telling you to. Dont make me take away that phone young man!
[[|Scare]]#So, if I could erase all your other employees from existence, then would you stop playing on your phone?
