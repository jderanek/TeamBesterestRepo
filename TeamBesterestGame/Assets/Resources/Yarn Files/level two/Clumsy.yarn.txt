#So, what is your deal?
Clumsy:    #Well, if you dont know me, you should, because I am the best juggler you will ever know, and my specialty, is throwing knives.
[[|Example]]#Really, sorry I didn't know of you prior, can you show me?
[[|Question]]#Why do you prefer throwing knives?
[[|Wannabe]]#So, you a Goblin, but also a wannabe Ninja... o boy... not much to work with here I see.
[[|Sports]]#Do you like sports? (*Requires knowledge of Sporty's sport love)
[[|PutDown]]#Before we move further, put down those knives Clumsy. No questions, NOW.(*Requires knowledge of Sporty's prior death)

Clumsy:   #Well, if you want to know, I believe the Ninja Warriors are some of the greatest fighters of all time. There is no group of monsters OR heroes that could take these guys on.
[[|Confused]]#But Ninjas are usually stealthy right, not going around yelling how they are Ninjas right?
[[|Knowledge]]#But you are a Goblin in a corporate Dungeon, how do you know so much about Ninjas?
[[|Example]]#Well, if you idolize Ninjas, show me your knife juggling why dont cha?

Clumsy:   #Because they remind me of the great Ninja Warrior told about in pasts long ago. The stealthy fighters who were able to control knives with upmost precision, able to hit a target from miles away.
[[|Disprove]]#Well, if these warriors were so stealthy, then how come you know about them? Shouldn't the world not know of their prescence? And why would you tell me about them?
[[|History]]#Yeah, but could they survive a Dungeon being invaded by Heroes? Because one thing I do know is that so far you haven't been able to.
[[|Example]]#Sounds interesting, why dont you show me these awesome knife throwing technique?

*Clumsy stands up and runs towards a target on the way, however Clumsy begins to trip and throws the knife anyways, the knife turns around mid air and hits Sports in the leg.
#Okay, it appears you might be a big clumsy there Clumsy.
Clumsy:    #Oopsies.

I am no Ninja yet, I must first hone my body, before I begin to sharpen my mind. And I do that by practicing my knife throwing techniques.
[[|Example]]#Okay, mind if you show me these skills?

Because my phsyical appearance as a Goblin doesn't hide my soul as a Ninja. I was born with this knowledge, born with this ability to learn the ways of the Ninja... and the local library had a couple books on shelf.
[[|Example]]#Well, dont dissapoint your Ninja family, show me your skills with the blade.

#So, how are we going to deal with your clumsiness?
Clumsy:   #Not sure, what would you recommend Time-Wizard?
[[|PutOff]]#Why not just wait to practice knife throwing at home?
[[|DifWeapon]]#How about instead of Knives, you use a different weapon?
[[|Practice]]#Ill encourage you to practice ALL DAY, but promise me youll wear gloves as to not hurt yourself.
[[|TeamAttack]]#Why dont you and Sporty take time to learn some form of "Team Combo" that utilizes both of your strengths? (*Requires Sporty being willing to do team combo)
[[|Range]]#Why dont you go down to the shooting range and get some practice done there? (*Requires knowledge of Range from Sporty)

Clumsy:   #But my Ninja training has only taught me how to use knives? I dont know any other weapon arts?
[[|Katana]]#Arent Ninjas welled trained in the use of the Katana? Why not start using one of those?
[[|Shuriken]]#Ninjas use Shurikens just as much as throwing knives right? Why not use those?
[[|Fist]]#Ninjas dont only rely on tools to get the job done, why not train your body and your fist to do the fighting? A.K.A. Punch the Heroes.
[[|Ninjutsu]]#Ninjas are expert spell users right? They can like shoot fireballs from their hands im pretty sure, you should learn that. That would be cool.
